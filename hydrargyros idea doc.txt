Progression

Planet Discovery will unlock Steel Gears, Steel Pipe and the Mercuric Chamber

Iron Nodules will Dot the landscape Stone, Pyrite, and Copper Chloride, are minable by hand 

T0

Iron Nodules yield Vanilla Iron Ore
Offshore pump, Stone Furnace, and Crude Mixing Chamber will all be craft able from Iron and Stone only

This allows one to automate steam and heat with no outside resources

Stone Furnace Makes Iron Plates from Iron Ore 
Offshore pump Acquires Liquid Mercury and Brine
Mercuric Chamber makes 70C steam by combining the new two liquids
Steam enters the Steam Heater and heats the attached buildings

AI output Terrain Desc.

General Terrain Themes

    Barren, Cracked Plains: Most of the terrain would appear dry, fractured, and chemically etched. Mercury and brine would form shallow basins or slow-moving slicks.

    Corrosive Pools: Pools of shimmering liquid mercury, possibly mixed with brine, sit in lowlands. These are reflective and mirror-like, surrounded by crusty mineral deposits.

    Dusty, Pale Sediment: Fine, ash-colored magnesium and calcium salts crust the ground, easily disturbed into clouds by movement.

    Bright Mineral Veins: Exposed ores like copper chloride (green-blue) and pyrite (metallic gold) would form streaks through otherwise color-bleached terrain.

üí® Atmospheric Influence

    Chlorine Fog: A yellow-green haze permeates low-lying areas. Visibility is reduced; anything unprotected corrodes quickly.

    Corrosion Stains: Rust-colored and greenish corrosion streaks on exposed metals and rocks show the damage of constant chlorine and mercury vapor exposure.

    No Vegetation: Life as we know it would not survive. All surfaces are bare, mechanical, and chemical.

üå°Ô∏è Thermal Features

    Thermal Vents: Bright orange or red vents releasing heat and chlorine could be found in geologically active zones.

    Cracked Heat Scars: Surface around high-heat structures (like chemical plants) might be blistered or glassy, showing thermal damage.

üåä Mercury and Brine Oceans

    Mercury Ocean: Heavy, silvery seas that ripple sluggishly. Shorelines might have strange ‚Äútidemarks‚Äù of fused minerals or crystallized chlorides.

    Brine Flats: Magnesium chloride brine forms shallow, oily lakes with crusted salt flats at the edges. Evaporation leaves glittery, white deposits.
