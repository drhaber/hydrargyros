Progression

Planet Discovery will Unlock Steel Gears, Steel Pipe and the Mercuric Chamber

Iron Nodules will Dot the landscape Stone, Pyrite, and Copper Chloride, are minable by hand 

T0

Iron Nodules yield Vanilla Iron Ore
Offshore pump, Steam Heater, Stone Furnace, and Crude Mixing Chamber will both be craftable from Iron and Stone only

This allows one to automate steam and heat with no outside resources

Stone Furnace Makes Iron Plates from Iron Ore and from Copper ore
Offshore pump Acquires Liquid Mercury and Brine
Mercuric Chamber makes 70C steam by combining the new two liquids
Steam enters the Steam Heater and heats the attached buildings 

Mercuric Fumication Chamber <- Steel Gears, Steel Pipes, Stone Brick, Steel Plate, Lime Glass
Steam Heater <- Mercury Amalgam Plate, Steel Pipes, Stone Brick,Steel Plate

Copper Mercury Amalgam <- Copper chloride, Mercury <> Mercuric Fumication Chamber
